# Bee

A swift package that models the Spelling Bee game, especially the german
newspaper _Die Zeit_ version found here: [Buchstabenbiene](https://spiele.zeit.de/buchstabiene/)

In this game you have to produce words from a given set of characters. 

The implemented `BeeDictionary` finds candidates from a contained dictionary of
~2M german words.

The dictionary is from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/germandict/

I built this to explore Swift concurrency.
